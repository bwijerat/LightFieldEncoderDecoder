# LightFieldEncoderDecoder
CNN based auto-encoder for Light Field compression - PyTorch

This project explored the possibility of building a deep CNN autoencoder for light field compression by exploiting the small variations present in sub-regions of the light field. A branch based network architecture was incrementally improved by modifying and testing network configurations along with updating the training scheme by varying the data sampling scheme, regularization approaches and other relevant algorithms.
